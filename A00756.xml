            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Here is no doubt, but that our new Phiſicke and Chyrurgerie, is better then that, the which the Ancients haue vſed: becauſe it helpeth the ſicke with more caſe and ſpéede, and much more ſafer: and to ſhew the truth, the Ancients had neuer knowledge of our <hi>Dia Aromatico,</hi> nor of <hi>Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio Angelica,</hi> nor of our <hi>Pillole Aquilone,</hi> nor did not make our <hi>Siropo ſolutiuo,</hi> nor yet our <hi>Magno licore,</hi> with a number of other medicines found out by me, the which are written in the ende of this booke, with the which I haue done wonderfull cures, as thou maiſt read in my <hi>Theſoro de la vita humana,</hi> and truely moſt neceſſary for all profeſſours of this Arts, becauſe therein thou ſhalt ſtude ſo many goodly experiences, and it would cauſe the world to wonder thereat.

               <p>VLcers are of ſundrie kindes, and are ingendred of many cauſes, as hereafter I will ſhew. But firſt I will write of thoſe kinde of Vlcers that are cauſed of wounds. You ſhall vnderſtand that wounds in what part of the body ſoeuer they be, being impoſtumated, or cancrenated, they change their names, and are no more called wounds, although the originall was a wound. For when it is cancrenated, it is called <hi>Vlcera coraſiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when it is neither can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crenated nor yet apoſtumated, but that through ſome euill diſpoſition the wound is cloſed, and that there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in it euill qualities without alteration, then it is called, <hi>Vlcera ſordida,</hi> becauſe therein is euill qualitie, &amp; it appeareth but a little, but it is euill to heale. There be other ſorts of Vlcers alſo, the which are cauſed of diuers and ſundry kindes of tumors, and the moſt euill and miſchieuous, are thoſe that are of tumors cauſed of the pox, for vnto thoſe there runneth aboundance of euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that augment the Vlcer, and they be the worſt ſort, for they cannot be healed by themſelues, except the body be well purged and euacuated of all humors that are offenſiue. There is another kinde of Vlcer the which commeth of an Impoſtume, as well hot as cold, and thoſe are more gentle and eaſie to be helpt, if ye know the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that are apt to helpe and diſſolue thoſe kinde of Vlcers.

               <p>THis procéedeth of two cauſes principally, the firſt is of ſuperfluous heat of the body, through the which heat, nature doth aſſuttiliate too much that humid part, and continually doth ſend it downe into the bladder: the ſecond cauſe is, that the pores are too much relaxed or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, by the which operation the vrine doth paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out retention: and theſe are the two cauſes why the vrin cannot ſtay, and this commeth commonly to yong chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe they are very hotte of complexion, and the order to help them is this:</p>
               <p>Giue them our <hi>Pillole Aquilone</hi> thrée times, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie is from one dram, to one and a halfe: that being done, ye ſhall make them a decoction of Hiſop of the mountaine, and put therin ſugar, and this they ſhall vſe x. or xij. dayes at the leaſt, for this mundifieth the place offended, and diſpoſeth it to ſolution. Then after this is done, ye ſhall giue him for x. dayes together halfe a dram of Maſticke with a little Plantine water, for this is hot and reſtringeth the pores, and ingroſſeth the vrine, and ſo the Patient ſhall remaine whole of that infirmity, by the vertue of the aforeſaid thrée medicines, and it is a very eaſie cure and ſoueraigne for that purpoſe. But ſometime there happeneth a flux of vrine ſomewhat like this, and it is not of the aforeſaid cauſes, but of cauſes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14618:21"/>much different from them, for this is in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of age, and this I finde to be cauſed of the Poxe that cauſeth the flux, and they void certaine threds which ſome call <hi>Gonorea,</hi> and the remedie thereof is onely with great purging and ſweating, and then to annoint them fiue or ſix nights with our <hi>Vnguento magno,</hi> and kéepe them warme in bed vntill ye haue ended to annoint him, and then goe to the ſtowe, and hée ſhall be helpt of that infirmitie.</p>

               <p>THe vrine is ſtayed through diuers and ſundry cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the principall are thrée, of the which one is the ſtone that ingendreth in the bladder, for alwayes it hangeth downe in the necke of the bladder, &amp; ſtoppeth the <hi>Meati</hi> or pores that the vrine cannot paſſe, the which grieueth the patient meruaileufly. The other is cauſed of grauell or groſe and viſcous humours that cannot paſſe the pores, and ſo cauſe that retention of vrine with great paine. The third is cauſed of an obſtruction or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of the pores or conduites, where the vrine doth paſſe, &amp; ſo kéep the vrine within with great paine, ſo that theſe be the three chiefeſt cauſes of the retention of vrine.</p>
               <p>The cure of the firſt cauſe which is the ſtone, is to purge them well, and then to vſe our moſt ſouerain reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that is written in this booke following, the which is of great vertue to breake the ſtone, as I haue proued many times, but when this medicine is not able to break it, then it is neceſſary to cut it forth, and this is all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>To helpe the ſecond cauſe, it were neceſſary to vſe purgations that purge the reines well, and then to giue them our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> and then to annoint the reines ſix dayes euery day once with <hi>Vnguento magno,</hi> and with this medicine thou ſhalt helpe him perfectly.</p>

Neuertheles, I called <hi>Armellio, &amp; Leonardo Teſta,</hi> two excellent Phiſitions, which gaue their counſell to take no medicine, neuertheles I proued that the Gout was extreme hot, and for that I ordayned a colde Sirope to mittigate the ſuperfluous heat, which was made of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwort, Harts tongue Dates, Raiſins, Figs, Sugar, and Succory water, and Aromatiſed it with Muſke and Roſe water, of the which he tooke euery day four ounces, and for the alteration of the Gout, I waſhed it thrée or foure times a day with our <hi>Aqua del Balſamo,</hi> becauſe it penetrateth and openeth the pores and aſſuttiliateth and dryeth the humor offenſiue, alſo I ordayned him bread of Barly, becauſe it cooleth the blood and is of good diſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and cauſed him to refraine from all fatt brothes, and his drink was temperate, And to this one of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors did agrée, but the other would not, neuertheles the Gentleman was content with my aduiſe: then I began to giue him the aforeſaid decoction, with our ſoluble <hi>Quinteſſence,</hi> and therwith he had euery day two or thrée ſtooles, and I waſhed the Gout three or four times a day with our <hi>Aqua Balſami,</hi> and the firſt day he began to feele eaſe, and the ſecond he felt more, ſo that in ſeauen dayes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14618:27"/>all his payne was taken away: then I applyed therunto our ſecret of ſecrets, for that kind of diſeaſe, which in thrée dayes deliuered him: then I cauſed him to vſe certaine medicines to defend the Gout for comming againe, and ſo he continued who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THere hath always béene a great queſtioning among the Philoſophers, whether that one medicine might helpe againſt all diſeaſes or no. The which I affirme, and will approue with ſufficient reaſon, that the <hi>Petra Philoſophalle</hi> made of our inuention, may helpe againſt all the infirmities that commeth vnto mans body, and two onely reaſons I will ſhewe thée with breuitie: the firſt of them is this, that all ſorts of infirmities haue their originall and beginning of the ſtomacke, and to know the truth ye may ſe manifeſtly, that if the body be neuer ſo little infirmid the ſtomacke is alſo grieued: For ye may ſée how the animals terreſtriall, neuer help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of other infirmity than of the ſtomacke, and when they will help themſelues, they eat hearbes, the which cauſeth them to vomit, and this doth ſignifie that they haue no other infirmity than the aforeſaid, ſo by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the animals I approue that the infirmitie is cauſed of the ſtomacke, and this is the firſt reaſon. The
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14618:37"/>ſecond is, that all the medicines wherein our <hi>Petra Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophalle</hi> is put, as ſoone as they are come into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, it draweth vnto it all the euill humours of the ſtomack, and of the whole body, and mixeth with them, and ſo Nature ſendeth them forth by vomit or by ſege, or both, and ſo the ſtomacke ſhall be euacuated of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the body remaine free from impediments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, ſo that by this reaſon I affirme that our <hi>Petra Philoſophalle</hi> may helpe againſt all ſorts of infirmities, and to knowe the truth, I haue proued it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, in all manner of infirmities, and alwayes haue found it to doe much good vnto all men, and hurt none vnto my knowledge, and the order to make this <hi>Petra Philoſophalle,</hi> is thus:</p>

               <hi>Aqua caeleſtis</hi> is of two kinds, as we will declare in this preſent Chapter. If ye mingle with it as much of the water called mother of Balme and ſtill it againe, ye haue the treaſure of all medicines. And if ye will ye may ſunder the foure elements one from another. Firſt wee will ſpeake of the vertues of theſe two waters: The firſt water is of ſuch vertue, that if it be put into a freſh wound it healeth it in 24. houres, ſo it be not mortall: and it healeth maligne Vlcers, Cankers, <hi>Noli me tange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> old wounds, within the ſpace of fifteene dayes if ye waſh them with the ſaid water euery third day; and if ye put a drop of it vpon a Carbuckle, it mortifieth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignitie of the ſame ſhortly. Item if ye put of the ſaid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the eye that hath loſt his ſight, ſo that it be not vtterly loſt, it ſhall be recouered within three dayes or eight at the vttermoſt: And if a man drinke a drop of it with a little good wine, it breaketh the ſtone in the ſpace of two houres, whether it be in the reines or in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It mollifieth hardned ſinewes if ye waſh them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: and many other vertues it hath, which for breuitie we ouer-paſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond water hath colour of blood, and is moſt precious: it preſerueth the body from diſeaſes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth the weake members chéefely of old men. It reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth remembrance, ſharpeneth the ſpirits, comforteth the heart, purifieth the blood, conſoundeth the longs, healeth all diſeaſes of the milte, and kéepeth the ioynts from Gouts, cauſeth good digeſtion, purgeth cold and rotten humours, healeth all Agues, and briefely it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth
